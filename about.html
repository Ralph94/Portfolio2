		<h2>About</h2>
		<!--<p>Software Engineer & Web Developer</p>-->
		<h2>Hi, I’m Rafael. I'm a multi-talented human with over 2+ years of
            experiences in wide range of  Web & Software disciplines.</h2>

         <p1>You can also call me a website designer, experience web developer, interaction, Django, Flask or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 10 years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines, manager, adviser, entrepreneur, front-end developer, back-end developer, boxer, traveler, hiker and more.

         I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done.</p1> 

         <div class="name-text2">
         <p2>I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.

         Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.

         My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors.</p2> 
        <div class="name-text3">
         <p3>I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.

         I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. My personality type is ENTJ. I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base and are open for new opportunities.

         You can read more about my experience, skills, education and much more in the PDF attached bellow:</p3>
